# Shared Health Plugin ❤️‍🔥

---

## 📌 Description
The **Shared Health Plugin** completely changes how survival gameplay works in Minecraft.  
All players on the server **share the same health, hunger, and absorption hearts**.

Whenever **one player takes damage, heals, eats, or gains absorption**, the effect is **instantly applied to every other player**.

This creates intense teamwork, chaos, and high-risk gameplay where **every mistake matters**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- One player takes damage → **everyone loses hearts**
- One player heals → **everyone heals**
- One player eats → **hunger syncs for all players**
- One player gains absorption (e.g. Golden Apple) → **absorption is shared**

All players are always kept in sync:
- ❤️ Health  
- 🍗 Hunger  
- 💛 Absorption Hearts  

---

## 🏆 Team-Based & Beatable
The plugin is designed for **cooperative gameplay**:

- No player is left behind
- Deaths affect the entire team
- Strategic play and communication are essential
- The game remains **fully beatable from start to finish**

One team. One life bar.
